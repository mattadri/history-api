Pressure on the peasants continued: taxes on peasants who remained in their property were high, deportations to fast-expanding Gulags increased, food shortages became permanent.	\N	2	\N	\N	2	\N	55	1930	1930

While it's own independent state it is believed to have had close connections with the Hittite empire and maintained both trade and diplomatic relationships with other empires of time. In the 13th century King Ammistamru is recorded as being king.	\N	1	\N	\N	1	\N	62	1260	1235

Muwattalli, the Hittite king, was attempting to expand the Hittite Empire farther south into Canaan. Ramses II of Egypt was determined to keep the border at Qadesh. This set the stage for one of the great battles from the ancient era and one of the first known where misinformation was deliberately used to confuse the enemy. The battle ended as a stalemate with a peace treaty between the two empires.	\N	1	\N	\N	1	\N	62	1274	1274

336	2020-04-23 19:48:54.37707	2020-04-23 19:48:54.37707	Hebrew Exodus From Egypt	If this event did occur clues suggest it likely occurred somewhere around the mid-13th century. According to the Book of Exodus the Hebrews were enslaved by the Egyptians after having lived there peacefully for around 400 year. Afterwards Moses led the Hebrews out of Egyptian bondage on a 40 year journey to the land of Canaan.	\N	1	\N	\N	1	\N	62	1240	1280

But according to the Bible the Hebrews entered Egypt some 400 years before they were enslaved and began the Exodus to Canaan. If that date is correct at some time during the 13th Century, then they would have entered egypt some time during the 17th Century. The bible indicates as well that they entered Egypt during the time of Jacob. Hence how this date was arrived at.	\N	1	\N	\N	1	\N	62	1650	1700

As a result they signed a treaty with the Amurru of what is today northern Syria. This created a bit of a buffer between themselves and the Assyrians along with the additional protection that comes in increasing the size of an alliance.	\N	1	\N	\N	1	\N	62	1225	1225

Originally the quickness of the destruction was believed to have been caused by an earthquake. But more recent archaeological evidence suggests it was destroyed as part of an attack. Scattered arrow heads and the fact that the populous fled the city and never returned both indicate attack as the reason.	\N	1	\N	\N	1	\N	62	1190	1185

Egyptian documents of the following trials indicate it as a plot hatched by a minor queen of the court to have her son succeed Ramses III as Pharaoh.  This has come to be known as the 'Harem Conspiracy'. Archaeologists working with the mummy of Ramses III have found he was stabbed in the throat causing most likely instantaneous death.	\N	1	\N	\N	1	\N	62	1184	1155

In response, the peasants' enthusiasm for growing, sowing, and storing grain plunged. In addition their ability to produce was very low in any case as up to a third of young men had been mobilized to fight in World War I, while even more had joined the civil war and had not returned.	226

They ate the meat, salted, sold it, or concealed it. Those who didn't slaughter their animals protected them ferociously. In a few cases animals where released into the streets.	238
72	2020-03-18 19:35:42.417379	2020-03-18 19:35:42.417379	Because peasants refused to cooperate, the idealistic young agitators from outside and their local allies grew angrier, their methods became more extreme and their violence harsher.	238

Like the serfs of old, they were forced to accept a special legal status, including controls of their movement. They couldn't decide any longer when to reap, sow and sell. They didn't earn regular salaries but were paid with "trudodni" or day wages, which often meant payment in kind (grain, potatoes, or other products) rather then cash. They lost their ability to govern themselves too, as collective farms bosses and their entourages supplanted the traditional village councils.	225
77	2020-03-18 19:58:25.00625	2020-03-18 19:58:25.00625	As a consequence recently self-reliant farmers now worked as little as possible since they couldn't see a direct return on their efforts. Collective farms produced dramatically less than they could or should have done. Stealing became a common practice, as State property was not respected. This form of "every-day" resistance characterized not only the peasantry but all kinds of underpaid, underfed, and unmotivated Soviet workers.	225

Some historians dismissed Imam Hussein's endeavor as a tale of failure; some saw a battle between two fallible men each seeking power; others described Hussein as a rebel standing up for justice against tyranny.

The plague ravaged the Hittite population killing may royals including Suppiluliuma I. In the eyes of Mursili this plague was retribution by the Gods for a murder that took place early in Supiluliuma's reign. This was the murder of Tudhaliya the Younger, Supiluliuma's brother.

While there he fell in love with Menelaus's beautiful wife, Helen. When Paris returned home, Helen accompanied him -- either voluntarily, according to the Trojans, or taken by force, according to the Greeks. Enraged, Menelaus persuaded his brother Agamemnon, King of Mycenae and the leader of the Greeks, to send an armada of a thousand ships and fifty thousand men against Troy to get Helen back. In the end, after a ten-year-long war, the Greeks were victorious. Troy was sacked, most of its inhabitants were killed, and Helen returned home to Sparta with Menelaus.	335

However, given that radio carbon dating has put this eruption at 1650 earliest, and most likely during 1628 BC it would seem impossible that this could be the explanation. The Bible places the Exodus some time in the 15th century, but archaeological evidence shows that if it did occur it would have most likely been during the 13th century. So either way the eruption either occurred two centuries or four centuries prior to the parting of the Red Sea story. 	340

The holy city of Najaf in Iraq was the hub where all ties converged. Sadr crossed boundaries of the mind too, opening worlds onto one another. In Tyre, he bought ice cream from a Christian whose business was suffering because his Shia neighbors believed anything made by non-Muslims was unclean. Christian women swooned over him, and though clerics were not supposed to shake hands with women, he occasionally made an exception out of politeness. He taught at Sunni schools, gave classes in Islamic philosophy at the St. Joseph University in Beirut, and prayed in churches all over the country. The imagery was striking as he stood behind the altar, beneath Jesus on a crucifix, facing a full church with his black turban denoting lineage traced back to the prophet Muhammad. He understood his different audiences. He spoke with melancholy to the priests and nuns and the flock gathered in a church, paying homage to Christ as an apostle of the oppressed; he thundered in Baalbek to the men with guns, rousing them from their sorrow with imagery of Imam Hussein, son of Ali and Fatima, grandson of the prophet, killed in battle in Karbala in the year 680.	57

7	2020-04-23 17:18:57.400946	2020-04-23 17:18:57.400946	As early as the 13th century BC Kings were exempting the wealthy from paying taxes. A wealthy Ugaritic merchant whose name was Sinaranu was exempted from taxes by the King of Ugarit Ammistamru II. The recovered text reads "From the present day Ammistamru, son of Niqmepa, King of Ugarit, exempts Sinaranu, son of Siginu ... His grain, his  beer, his olive oil to the palace he shall not deliver. His ship is exempt when it arrives from Crete.	Chapter 3	79	62
8	2020-04-23 17:31:18.551574	2020-04-23 17:31:18.551574	As far back (or possibly further) than the 15th century BC evidence shows the beginnings of international diplomacy and trade. For example a grand palace was built in 1477 in Egypt. The interesting thing about the  palace is the Minoan frescoes painted on it as part of the original construction. Minoans would have either had to travel to Egypt to create the frescoes or the Egyptian artists would have had to somehow known about both frescoes and the Minoan art style. Either way it's a clear indication of knowledge traveling very long distances.	Chapter 1	14	62
9	2020-04-23 19:21:36.539142	2020-04-23 19:21:36.539142	Interesting note about the word 'sesame'. 12th century Mycenaean tablets record imports of sesame seeds. Not having a word for them in the linear B language at the time they picked it up from the culture languages from which they were being imported. In Linear B the word is sa-sa-ma, which appears to be coming from the Ugaritic word ssmn, the Akkadian word sammassammu, and the Hurrian word sumisumi.	Chapter 3	88	62
10	2020-04-25 19:18:34.198801	2020-04-25 19:18:34.198801	Excavations of certain sites along the Mediterranean suggest that it's possible that the "Sea Peoples" had sailed into this area during the time of 1205 to 1185 BC. Some 7 to 28 years prior to the 2nd wave invasion recorded by Ramses III in 1177 BC. In this case though they seem to have settled in the cities in which they sailed to and integrated with the local populations. This would mean that the destruction of these areas by the Sea Peoples in 1177 BC would have also impacted their own people who had migrated there in the years prior.	Chapter 4	114	62
11	2020-04-25 19:32:05.134383	2020-04-25 19:32:05.134383	A 'Tell' is a location that has been rebuilt so many times it appears to sit on top of a hill. This is not a geographical hill however, but a rising as a consequence of having a place built on top of a previously destroyed place repeatedly. And example is the city of Megiddo in modern-day Israel. This is also the location of the Biblical Armageddon. Around 20 cities here have been found layered one on top of the other. The Book Of Revelations indicates that Armageddon would be on top of a mountain or hill. This referring to the place of Megiddo, and seeing it as a geographical feature, but in reality it's a man-made hill.	Chapter 4	114	62
12	2020-04-28 08:47:28.47608	2020-04-28 08:47:28.47608	POSSIBLE CAUSE OF COLLAPSE 1(EARTHQUAKES): Archaeoseismologiests have shown that there was apparently a series of earthquakes in the Aegean/Mediterranean area beginning about 1225 BC and lasting until about 1175 BC. While there is much evidence of earthquake damage and destruction at sites during this time period there is also evidence of rebuilding and reoccupation. It would also seem that earthquakes alone would not be enough to destroy a civilization. Likely a setback, but not a silver bullet of collapse.	Chapter 5	140	62
13	2020-04-28 09:06:35.057221	2020-04-28 09:06:35.057221	POSSIBLE CAUSE OF COLLAPSE 1(CLIMATE CHANGE): There is abundant evidence supporting climate change, particularly drought, in the eastern Mediterranean between around 1250 BC and 1100 BC. Historical documentation between civilizations indicate famine in the Hittite empire, Ugarit, Cyprus, and Syria. Drought may have also been present elsewhere in the Levant and into Egypt at times. Other evidence such as pollen analysis supports the theory as well. That said, drought was recorded at many times previous to this time period and certainly in times afterwards. And yet climate change does not always lead to the collapse of the civilization.  So while climate change most certainly appears to have played a role, it cannot be blamed solely.	Chapter 5	147	62
14	2020-04-28 09:13:58.713435	2020-04-28 09:13:58.713435	POSSIBLE CAUSE OF COLLAPSE 1(INTERNAL REBELLION): While it's likely that internal rebellion would have occurred to some extent given that it's possible earthquakes, famines, droughts, and changes in international trade between civilizations were likely taking place, this alone is not nearly sufficient to explain the collapse of multiple large and powerful empires. Internal rebellions rarely lead to the collapse of a civilization, but usually to a major change in that civilization.	Chapter 5	147	62
15	2020-04-28 09:38:36.483041	2020-04-28 09:38:36.483041	POSSIBLE CAUSE OF COLLAPSE 1(COLLAPSE OF TRADE): There is some amount of evidence, particularly from the city of Ugarit, that maritime marauders were causing issues at sea. It's not known the origins or these marauders, but letters found do indicate they were there and problematic. Since the sea was a primary trade route, and the city of Ugarit was heavily dependent on trade (particularly for copper and tin, primary ingredients in the creation of bronze), it's maybe safe to say that these ships at sea were disrupting the trade routes to and from the city. That said, Ugarit appears to be an exception as many trade routes through the late Bronze Age appear to have been without disruption. In fact Ugarit itself appears to have had a lively international trade right up to the end. So while probable, nothing conclusive about trade disruption being a source of the collapse of the larger civilizations.	Chapter 5	148	62
16	2020-04-28 16:56:00.557069	2020-04-28 16:56:00.557069	POSSIBLE CAUSE OF COLLAPSE 1(DECENTRALIZATION AND PRIVATE MERCHANTS): This is an idea more recently proposed. While it's clear that the palatial systems of economics fell during the late Bronze Age collapse, it's not clear whether this fall of centralization was the cause of the overall collapse of the civilization, or whether decentralization grew out of the collapse itself. Most likely it, like all the other alternatives is not solely responsible. Although in this particular case the argument can be made that the rise of small kingdoms and entrepreneurship was more of a product of the collapse than the cause itself.	Chapter 5	152	62
17	2020-04-28 19:18:02.792384	2020-04-28 19:18:02.792384	The "Sea Peoples" often take the blame for the collapse of civilizations in the late to mid-12th century BC. However, this is likely just not the case. Evidence suggests that in many cases the migrants simply settled down and assimilated into the cities in which they found themselves. In fact in many cases evidence suggests that these migrants were not at all raiding warriors bent on destruction. The big question is whether or not they were migrating due to issues at the origin, or if they were just taking advantage of the already collapsing empires to start a new and hopefully better life.	Chapter 5	150	62
18	2020-04-28 19:29:28.754735	2020-04-28 19:29:28.754735	POSSIBLE CAUSE OF COLLAPSE 1(SYSTEMS COLLAPSE): Another possibility that seems to be supported by the evidence is a systemic collapse. This is more entwined with the other possible reasons for collapse. That is to say that no single possibility - be it earthquakes, immigrations, internal rebellions, trade route disruptions, etc - would have been able to cause a single civilization to collapse much less most all of them. Instead, a more complex, but more likely proposal is a sort of domino effect where one event led to another event and to another. Spiraling out of control. Things got worse until the systems in place could no longer stand. This would indicate that these civilizations fell over a long period of time instead of the single invasion of a 'Sea People' event that many like to hold as the reason for collapse.	Chapter 5	160	62
19	2020-04-28 19:34:23.563609	2020-04-28 19:34:23.563609	Two things to note about the collapse itself. Each civilization was greatly centralized through the palatial system. That is the palace and the elites controlled all aspects of life. The second thing of note, is that these civilizations were not just in contact with one another, but highly invested and dependent upon trade with the others. If one civilization palatial system were to collapse it would take down the entirety of the empire with it due to the reliance of everything on it. And if that empire were to collapse it could have a ripple effect on the empires on which were dependent on trade with the collapsed empire. If this were to bring down their palatial system the cycle would continue until all palatial systems within the trade network were collapsed. Of note, Jared Diamond discusses this in his book Collapse concerning how trade can take down a series of otherwise independent cultures.	Chapter 5	165	62
