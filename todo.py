# TODO: add Eras model/schema. This should represent high level eras like the pleistocene eras. Need
# TODO: to determine how to separate this from the 'AD/BC' eras already included. Should use 'epochs' perhaps.


# TODO: add db table so that many timelines can be created. There will be one master timeline, but new timelines
# TODO: can be created with events, people, and cultures attached manually.
